# ReInforcement Learning   

This folder contains code to implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. The agents included learning using Thresholded Lexicographic ordering action selection algorithm with Q-learning and standard Q-Learning. The code provided implments the the Dynamic Economic Dispatch Domain enivronment. This code uses multiple agents to optimise the cost, emissions and violations functions. 

Currently, I am implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning from scratch using Java. The goal is to build a robust Machine Learning library to allow users to easily deploy Deep RL agents in a given environment.

Aside from my current research into Multi-Objective Multi-Agent RL, I hope to build a library of envronments and agents that can be imported into users code in Java and easily deployed. Hopefully this can lower the effort of entry for researchers in RL.
